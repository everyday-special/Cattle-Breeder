# Cattle-Breeder
My submission for the 2018 Github Game Jam

The game file is 'hybrid_game.py'. You need pygame to run.

Game Description:
GOAL: Collect a cow of each color. There are 12 cow colors: White, Brown, Black, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Purple, Brown with Black spots, White with Brown spots and White with Black spots. Mating cows of different colors may lead to different color combinations. Color groups display different patterns of inheritance such as co-dominance, incomplete dominance and traditional dominance. Try to figure out how the different colors are inherited!

Mate and buy cows to get one of each type.

Watch out for hungry wolves! They will attack and kill your cows if you don't attack them first. Bigger cows are more resistant to the wolf's attack.

You lose when you have 0 cows left or 1 cow and less than $200 left.

CONTROLS:

-Move the farmer with the mouse.

-Click and drag a cow to select it and move it around.

-While dragging a cow, hit 's' to sell the cow

-While dragging a cow, hover over another cow and hit 'space' to mate the two cows

-Hit 'space' while not dragging a cow to attack the wolf.

-Hit 'b' to buy a cow for $200.

-Hit 'p' to pause/play the game

-Hit 'q' to quit the game.
